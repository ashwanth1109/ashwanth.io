    Hi.
</Text>

I'm Ashwanth - currently a Software Architect (SDE-3) at Crossover for Work.
I'm a fullstack polyglot developer and I have experience writing code in TypeScript, Python, Golang, and a little bit of Java.

I typically work on SPAs built in React or Angular (Frontend), backed by serverless microservices in the AWS cloud infrastructure utilizing Lambda, API Gateway, AppSync, DynamoDB, RDS etc. or conventional servers built in Django or Express (Backend).
